# ParallelMergeSort
Development of "Parallel Merge Sort" on the Charm++ Framework

This project is a parallel merge sort writted in Charm++. The purpose is obtain a comparison between OpenMP and Charm++ frameworks, in terms of performance.
We has develop the 

Charm++ is a C++-based parallel programming system, founded on the migratable-objects programming model, and supported by a novel and powerful adaptive runtime system. It supports both irregular as well as regular applications, and can be used to specify task-parallelism as well as data parallelism in a single application. It automates dynamic load balancing for task-parallel as well as data-parallel applications, via separate suites of load-balancing strategies. Via its message-driven execution model, it supports automatic latency tolerance, modularity and parallel composition. Charm++ also supports automatic checkpoint/restart, as well as fault tolerance based on distributed checkpoints.
